# MinUI Beta Transition

Already running MinUI? Great, I hope you're enjoying it! Please uninstall your current version using the `TrimuiUpdate_uninstallMinUI.zip` that came with your beta before installing the latest. You probably already have it on your SD card but if not, the last of the NAND-based betas can be found [here][old_beta].

[old_beta]:https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/540168599063756802/819049832676720640/MinUI-0.105-20210310-0.zip

Once uninstalled (or if it says MinUI was not installed) continue to install the new beta. (You can also remove the old installer and uninstaller from your SD card.)

## Roms

Included in this zip is a Roms folder containing folders for each console MinUI currently supports. MinUI will create these folders for you when installed or updated but they'll be empty. You should probably preload them with roms and copy each folder to the Roms folder on your SD card before installing. Or not, I'm not the boss of you.

## Install

Copy `TrimuiUpdate_MinUI.zip` to the root of your SD card. Insert your SD card into the device, power it on, navigate to FILE, and open `TrimuiUpdate_MinUI.zip`. Welcome to MinUI.

A quick note: The MinUI installer is also an updater and becomes a launcher once installed. So don't remove it from your SD card. 

Once an update is available, just replace `TrimuiUpdate_MinUI.zip` with the latest version. From the stock UI, updating is the same as installing or launching. From MinUI, just launch Update which will appear below Tools when an update is detected on the SD card.

## Return to stock

Navigate to Tools and launch Stock UI. See you soon.

## Return to MinUI

Navigate to FILE and open TrimuiUpdate_MinUI.zip. Welcome back.
