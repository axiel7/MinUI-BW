MinUI+libmmenu
	suspend before poweroff and resume
		have the emulator register a suspend callback with libmmenu. 
		Then before sleep, the menu would display the suspending screen, 
		call the callback (which would save a normal state in an otherwise 
		inaccessible slot, say 99), then when it returns clear the screen 
		and write the suspended româ€™s path to /.minui/suspended.txt. If we 
		wake normally we delete the state and suspended.txt. But if we power 
		off before that happens and we find suspended.txt on next boot we 
		automatically open the rom and load slot 99 (and delete suspended.txt 
		so we have a clean launch next time unless we suspend again).
		
		will any emulator data be lost if you power off without quitting? 
			Saves?
			Settings?
			early on there was an issue if you didn't exit an emulator in a 
			specific way it would lose this stuff, maybe it's been addressed...
		
		I'm leaning against this because of pcsx's long save state save times
			if you put it to sleep by accident or the distraction took less time than expected
				you're stuck waiting for a suspend state you don't even need
			but I'm interested in consistency and parity so I don't want to leave it out of just pcsx...
			
I wonder if stock brightness at 0 still being set to 
	70 is what results in setting brightness to 0 
	during sleep having no effect on battery drain...
	no improvement but also no burn in so I'll leave it

usb audio
	has a negative affect on performance of emulators that are already struggling
		super nintendo
		wonderswan
	passing for now

look into GMenuNX's brightness modifications
	too much weirdness here
		looks good on revised board, gradual ramp to 9, barely perceptible change to 10
		but it hits max brightness by about 6-7 on my original device
	tried to fix with a Brightness Patch.pak that let you choose based on device but
		there's some weirdness around 0-1 brightness
			keymon will write 0 but won't set brightness to 0
			so if MinUI boots with brightness at 0 the screen doesn't turn on
			addressing that makes the lowest brightness 75
			it just feels messy
	
keymin
	this is waaaay beyond me :disappointed:
	feasible with what we've learned?
	keymon volume setting is broken with USB-C headphones/adapter
		it writes to device 6 instead of 3 (or 5 instead of 2)?

don't create rom folder on install/update
	I don't like when the stock launcher does it
	why would I do it? The zip file and readme cover how to do it
		hmm, what if you wan to add roms later, after you've ditched the zip?
		how would you know what was supported and where to put them?
			
file naming conventions
	use .txt for human readable data
	no extension when file has no data (eg. its presence is used as a flag)

mount an extracted Trimui factory restore image called "rootfs.fex.iso" as TRIMUI0104 with
	ext4fuse rootfs.fex.iso /Volumes/TRIMUI0104

vvvvvv
	needs data.zip from https://thelettervsixtim.es/makeandplay/
	swap is required to (attempt to) load audio
		setup
			dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/SDCARD/.minui/swapfile bs=1M count=128
			chmod 600 /mnt/SDCARD/.minui/swapfile
			mkswap /mnt/SDCARD/.minui/swapfile
			swapon /mnt/SDCARD/.minui/swapfile
		remove
			swapoff -a; rm -f /mnt/SDCARD/.minui/swapfile
	update PLATFORM_getOSDirectory() to write to pak
		strcpy(output, ".vvvvvv/");
	no music:
		Unable to load Magic Binary Music file: Unrecognized music format
		because trimui doesn't support ogg
			use temper/tremor?
	video isn't working
		only colors or noise are rendering
			is it the bit depth? abgr? both?

pcsx_rearmed
	double buffering restores emulator drawing and fixes emulator menu flicker
	but Sony Computer Entertainment America screen still flickers
	gambatte doesn't use double buffering but doesn't have any problem drawing...
		is pcsx setting an SDL or build flag that's causing a shared SDL context?
	can get same results with single buffering by moving dlopen to top of main()
		before plat_init() is called and our video is setup
	guys reporting that the flicker happens on a MinUI-less build so I'm going to ignore this issue for now

when matching extensions the file system is case-insensitive (but case-preserving)
	match_prefix/suffix() are now case-insensitive
	exact_match() is still case-sensitive

what to do about pbp
	pcsx doesn't provide a great interface for switching discs (next disc, no indication of what disc you're currently on)
	so nothin?
	
picodrive
	swapping discs via mmenu requires two presses of START
		I should not worry about this, no one is going to use it...
	patch sound from 1.95 per eggs suggestion
		didn't work, Sonic title just had percussion, tried this: https://discord.com/channels/529983248114122762/540168599063756802/824470219497537586
		also tried just replacing my pico/sound/ with the one from eggs source, but that wouldn't build

problem cloning or adding a submodule with this error?
	The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP address)' can't be established.
	you're probably trying to use git from the toolchain environment :face_palm:

git submodules are back on their bullshit
	Fork is asking for my password to push my fork of picodrive used as a submodule by minui...
	I can't remember how I resolved this before...
	the issue was gitmodules and the individual .git/config files were using the url of the repo
		https://github.com/shauninman/picodrive
	not git@github.com:shauninman/picodrive.git
	once I manually changed it over it started working
	
ugh, my submodules have all lost their upstream remotes?
	need to re-add everytime you clone apparently
		git remote add upstream ...

figure out how to distribute Zero Stock.pak
	or maybe don't? I did, for people who use separate cards

redo emulator name detection to support subfolders
	it should be working as is...
	
cavestory
	how does ShowMenu() work with games? does it?
		can I just hack it to create a save anywhere? (probably not...right?)
			look into SaveProfile() and LoadProfile()
				got saving working, could not figure out loading...
				
move saves to common folder
	but which common folder?
	on second thought, since these folders are all invisible,
		I don't love the idea of saves being too far away from a folder highly trafficked by the player...

kill/relaunch keymon on sleep/wake? or killall -s STOP/CONT keymon
	makes relaunching MinUI crashy, the audio device disappears, seemingly permanently
	was this interacting poorly with suspending the display? or independent of that?

show charging status
	prevent auto sleep when charging
	can't
		/sys/devices/soc/1c23400.battery/charging is always present and always empty :sob:

	is there an equivalent for audio or memory?

try running find in /sys on device
