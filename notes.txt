add eggs' custom keymon?
	I think I might fork it to remove suspend and dependence on system.json
	write brightness and volume to files in .minui?
	update brightness to have 20 steps with 3 unit intervals from 60-120 or 65-125?
	leave as is for now (more to maintain, no real added benefit)
	tried integrating but its dependence on tinyalsa is a dealbreaker
		requires linking to all emulators
		didn't always work (in hindsight I'm realizing this might be because 
			the makefile was the only thing changed so in the cases where it 
			didn't work, maybe they didn't actually recompile)
	
building SDL 1.2
	git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL-1.2.git
	search source for `sdl_nomouse =` and set it to "1"
	export CC=/opt/trimui-toolchain/bin/arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabi-gcc; ./configure --host=arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabi --enable-input-tslib=no
	make
	load it up by putting it somewhere in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

can we fix the orphaned clusters SD card problem or would that require kernel changes?

is tearing patch affecting battery?
	or is my battery just wearing out from being fully charged all the time?
	is the device running hotter?
	can we reverse it to improve battery when sleeping?
		check eggs tearing test source	
	also look into CPU Timer, page 84 of F1C200s manual
	I think it might just be my battery... :\
	
add more variation/peripheral paks?
		WonderSwan Color.pak?
		Sega CD.pak?
		Sega 32x.pak?
		TurboGrafx-CD.pak?
	or remove all variations and leave it up to the user to create and organize?
	maybe don't create any Rom folders, let people choose from the zip?

add tips to boot image?
	System/launch.sh would check for .minui/boot.bmp
		if it doesn't exist, copy it from nand
		then replace it with an image with a random tip on it
		StockUI.pak/launch.sh would restore (for the dual booters)
	adds unnecessary delay to boot + risk of bad nand writes not worth it for 4-5 tips

something to watch out for:
	launching games with a remapped pak when the target paks roms folder doesn't exist 
		breaks all saving (in-game, states, settings)

could MinUI (and it's family of emulators) be ported to this?
	https://a.aliexpress.com/_mL5bVUp
	to share an SD/save states across a portable and home console

MinUI+libmmenu
	suspend before poweroff and resume
		have the emulator register a suspend callback with libmmenu. 
		Then before sleep, the menu would display the suspending screen, 
		call the callback (which would save a normal state in an otherwise 
		inaccessible slot, say 99), then when it returns clear the screen 
		and write the suspended româ€™s path to /.minui/suspended.txt. If we 
		wake normally we delete the state and suspended.txt. But if we power 
		off before that happens and we find suspended.txt on next boot we 
		automatically open the rom and load slot 99 (and delete suspended.txt 
		so we have a clean launch next time unless we suspend again).
		
		will any emulator data be lost if you power off without quitting? 
			Saves?
			Settings?
			early on there was an issue if you didn't exit an emulator in a 
			specific way it would lose this stuff, maybe it's been addressed...
		
		I'm leaning against this because of pcsx's long save state save times
			if you put it to sleep by accident or the distraction took less time than expected
				you're stuck waiting for a suspend state you don't even need
			but I'm interested in consistency and parity so I don't want to leave it out of just pcsx...
			
I wonder if stock brightness at 0 still being set to 
	70 is what results in setting brightness to 0 
	during sleep having no effect on battery drain...
	no improvement but also no burn in so I'll leave it

usb audio
	has a negative affect on performance of emulators that are already struggling
		super nintendo
		wonderswan
	passing for now

keymin
	this is waaaay beyond me :disappointed:
	feasible with what we've learned?
	keymon volume setting is broken with USB-C headphones/adapter
		it writes to device 6 instead of 3 (or 5 instead of 2)?

don't create rom folder on install/update
	I don't like when the stock launcher does it
	why would I do it? The zip file and readme cover how to do it
		hmm, what if you wan to add roms later, after you've ditched the zip?
		how would you know what was supported and where to put them?
			
file naming conventions
	use .txt for human readable data
	no extension when file has no data (eg. its presence is used as a flag)

mount an extracted Trimui factory restore image called "rootfs.fex.iso" as TRIMUI0104 with

	video isn't working
		only colors or noise are rendering

pcsx_rearmed
	double buffering restores emulator drawing and fixes emulator menu flicker
	but Sony Computer Entertainment America screen still flickers
	gambatte doesn't use double buffering but doesn't have any problem drawing...
		is pcsx setting an SDL or build flag that's causing a shared SDL context?
	can get same results with single buffering by moving dlopen to top of main()
		before plat_init() is called and our video is setup
	guys reporting that the flicker happens on a MinUI-less build so I'm going to ignore this issue for now

when matching extensions the file system is case-insensitive (but case-preserving)
	match_prefix/suffix() are now case-insensitive
	exact_match() is still case-sensitive

what to do about pbp
	pcsx doesn't provide a great interface for switching discs (next disc, no indication of what disc you're currently on)
	so nothin?
	
picodrive
	swapping discs via mmenu requires two presses of START
		I should not worry about this, no one is going to use it...
	patch sound from 1.95 per eggs suggestion
		didn't work, Sonic title just had percussion, tried this: https://discord.com/channels/529983248114122762/540168599063756802/824470219497537586
		also tried just replacing my pico/sound/ with the one from eggs source, but that wouldn't build

problem cloning or adding a submodule with this error?
	The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP address)' can't be established.
	you're probably trying to use git from the toolchain environment :face_palm:

git submodules are back on their bullshit
	Fork is asking for my password to push my fork of picodrive used as a submodule by minui...
	I can't remember how I resolved this before...
	the issue was gitmodules and the individual .git/config files were using the url of the repo
		https://github.com/shauninman/picodrive
	not git@github.com:shauninman/picodrive.git
	once I manually changed it over it started working
	
ugh, my submodules have all lost their upstream remotes?
	need to re-add everytime you clone apparently
		git remote add upstream <url>

figure out how to distribute Zero Stock.pak
	or maybe don't? I did, for people who use separate cards

redo emulator name detection to support subfolders
	it should be working as is...
	
cavestory
	how does ShowMenu() work with games? does it?
		can I just hack it to create a save anywhere? (probably not...right?)
			look into SaveProfile() and LoadProfile()
				got saving working, could not figure out loading...
				
move saves to common folder
	but which common folder?
	on second thought, since these folders are all invisible,
		I don't love the idea of saves being too far away from a folder highly trafficked by the player...

kill/relaunch keymon on sleep/wake? or killall -s STOP/CONT keymon
	makes relaunching MinUI crashy, the audio device disappears, seemingly permanently
	was this interacting poorly with suspending the display? or independent of that?
