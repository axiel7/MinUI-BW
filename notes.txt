	no music:
		Unable to load Magic Binary Music file: Unrecognized music format

	video isn't working

			is it the bit depth? abgr? both?

pcsx_rearmed
	double buffering restores emulator drawing and fixes emulator menu flicker
	but Sony Computer Entertainment America screen still flickers
	gambatte doesn't use double buffering but doesn't have any problem drawing...
		is pcsx setting an SDL or build flag that's causing a shared SDL context?
	can get same results with single buffering by moving dlopen to top of main()
		before plat_init() is called and our video is setup
	guys reporting that the flicker happens on a MinUI-less build so I'm going to ignore this issue for now

when matching extensions the file system is case-insensitive (but case-preserving)
	match_prefix/suffix() are now case-insensitive
	exact_match() is still case-sensitive

what to do about pbp
	pcsx doesn't provide a great interface for switching discs (next disc, no indication of what disc you're currently on)
	so nothin?
	
picodrive
	swapping discs via mmenu requires two presses of START
		I should not worry about this, no one is going to use it...
	patch sound from 1.95 per eggs suggestion
		didn't work, Sonic title just had percussion, tried this: https://discord.com/channels/529983248114122762/540168599063756802/824470219497537586
		also tried just replacing my pico/sound/ with the one from eggs source, but that wouldn't build

problem cloning or adding a submodule with this error?
	The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP address)' can't be established.
	you're probably trying to use git from the toolchain environment :face_palm:

git submodules are back on their bullshit
	Fork is asking for my password to push my fork of picodrive used as a submodule by minui...
	I can't remember how I resolved this before...
	the issue was gitmodules and the individual .git/config files were using the url of the repo
		https://github.com/shauninman/picodrive
	not git@github.com:shauninman/picodrive.git
	once I manually changed it over it started working
	
ugh, my submodules have all lost their upstream remotes?
	need to re-add everytime you clone apparently
		git remote add upstream ...

add secret screenshot key to MinUI and mmenu?
	how to name? Trimui doesn't have a system clock :sob:
		just straight increment?

figure out how to distribute Zero Stock.pak
	or maybe don't? I did, for people who use separate cards

redo emulator name detection to support subfolders
	it should be working as is...
	
cavestory
	how does ShowMenu() work with games? does it?
		can I just hack it to create a save anywhere? (probably not...right?)
			look into SaveProfile() and LoadProfile()
				got saving working, could not figure out loading...
				
move saves to common folder
	but which common folder?
	on second thought, since these folders are all invisible,
		I don't love the idea of saves being too far away from 
		a folder highly trafficked by the player...

kill/relaunch keymon on sleep/wake? or killall -s STOP/CONT keymon
	makes relaunching MinUI crashy, the audio device disappears, seemingly permanently
	was this interacting poorly with suspending the display? or independent of that?

show charging status
	prevent auto sleep when charging
	can't
		/sys/devices/soc/1c23400.battery/charging is always present and always empty :sob:

	turn off display
		echo 1 > /sys/devices/virtual/disp/disp/attr/suspend

	is there an equivalent for audio or memory?

try running find in /sys on device
