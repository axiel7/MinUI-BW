=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists
	
=======================================

Release Notes:

- added Lynx emulator
- MinUI remembers the selected entry if you accidentally back out of and then go back into the same directory
- MinUI only creates rom folders when installing a new emulator, not when updating an existing one

As always, thanks eggs, neonloop, and gameblabla!

=======================================

add WonderSwan Color.pak?

Info.pak with credits and a QR code linking to the Releases page on GitHub or the readme? Both?

MinUI
	look at how GMenuNX launches emulators
		 uses exec() to replace itself with the emulator
		 could allow me to get rid of next.sh
	
	is there a way to remember the MinUI name for a pak?
		so a pak can be updated even if renamed?
		if <name>.pak/default_name.txt doesn't exist write <name> to it
			do shell scripts have arrays? hashes?
			maybe before updating each we build a list mapping default to custom
			then when updating we look up the custom path from the default one in that file?

	is tearing patch affecting battery?
		is the device running hotter?
		can we reverse it to improve battery when sleeping?
			check eggs tearing test source	
		also look into CPU Timer, page 84 of F1C200s manual
		
	I wonder if stock brightness at 0 still being set to 
		70 is what results in setting brightness to 0 
		during sleep having no effect on battery drain...
		test tonight
	
	file system based settings?
		checkboxes (eg. enable screenshots, enable suspend/resume)
		select menus (eg. sleep timeout/disable)

MinUI+libmmenu
	suspend before poweroff and resume
		have the emulator register a suspend callback with libmmenu. 
		Then before sleep, the menu would display the suspending screen, 
		call the callback (which would save a normal state in an otherwise 
		inaccessible slot, say 99), then when it returns clear the screen 
		and write the suspended româ€™s path to /.minui/suspended.txt. If we 
		wake normally we delete the state and suspended.txt. But if we power 
		off before that happens and we find suspended.txt on next boot we 
		automatically open the rom and load slot 99 (and delete suspended.txt 
		so we have a clean launch next time unless we suspend again).
		
		will any emulator data be lost if you power off without quitting? 
			Saves?
			Settings?
			early on there was an issue if you didn't exit an emulator in a 
			specific way it would lose this stuff, maybe it's been addressed...

flipbook
	add an x/y pill overlay that disappears 1-2 seconds after changing images?

emulators
	all
		-
	oswan
		eggs has more scalers (waiting to hear back if he was seeking feedback or recommending for release)
	standardize bios locations
		I would prefer they all live in the emu folder not the rom folder but...
	picogpsp
		finish integrating
		update post.sh in Game Boy Advance.pak
			nand gba_bios.bin is no longer necessary
			if .gpsp folder exists
				copy any .sav files from .gpsp into .picogpsp
				delete .gpsp folder
				delete .mmenu folder (save states aren't compatible but is this necessary?)
				delete gpsp binary (or leave to allow editing the launch.sh?)
		update old gpsp repo description 
			retired
			link to picogpsp repo
	pokemini
		should power off before exiting
	handy
		doesn't save config?
		check libretro for updates to core
			Trioan fixes from early 2020 worth looking into? https://github.com/libretro/libretro-handy/commits/master?after=358f50b22a722427d5fe73a372e6a27c24ac5a8c+34&branch=master
		profile with California Games
			kinda helped
			try without -flto
	scummvm
		https://git.crowdedwood.com/scummvm-rg350/
		maybe MinUI could special case its weird rom format?

general
	add a quickstart section to readme
		make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
		add info about USB Bridge + webadb.com to upload files over USB
		also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
			not actually necessary
		mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions?
		document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator
		document no-update file in paks
	
	wrap functions shared by MinUI, utilities, and libmmenu into a shared source file?
		yes, please!
	
	document submodule upstream urls (for myself) since they get lost when cloned
		automate somehow?

	can we fix the orphaned clusters SD card problem or would that require kernel changes?

paks
	make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak?

games
	vvvvvv

	cavestory
		change Plantation password to "yrotS evaC" (or at least remove the leading "L" from the existing password)
		can I ever release this?
			as a diff of another cse2 release? do those even exist?
