figure out an update mechanism

scroll long names?

switch to eggs' .tmp_update soft-install method?

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection

rescue things from old repo
	art
	todos

pull in (need to find base source repos closest to eggs)
	fceux
	picodrive
	temper
	snes9x4d, this one https://github.com/m45t3r/snes9x4d?
