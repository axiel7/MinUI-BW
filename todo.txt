=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists

Release Notes

- pulled latest changes to Game Gear/Master System emulator

=======================================

kill tee whenever we kill updateui?

is tearing patch affecting battery?
	can we reverse it to improve battery when sleeping?
		check eggs tearing test source	
	also look into CPU Timer, page 84 of F1C200s manual

get picodrive in next so I can remove bin/encode

look into GMenuNX's brightness modifications

can MinUI load directly into a save slot?
	press X to Resume (using most recently saved slot?) instead of A to Open? or press SELECT to toggle a mode? show preview image?
	we can detect saves in the .mmenu folder
		each emulator would have to be updated to load a slot by number (most are probably by filename...)

allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting	
	update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
	or add entry->sortName
	check sorting logic to make sure it isn't converting all non-alpha to 0
		sort dir above rom?

games
	cavestory
		add SetMenuMode() && ShowMenu()

pak
	add a filter.txt to only show files with extensions in the filter list
		should it be an ignore list or a match list? match makes more sense I think
		eg. PlayStation.pak/filter.txt could contain bin since it favors .cue

make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak?

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
	also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
	note PlayStation bios location
	mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions

document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator

libmmenu
	add support for switching discs on disc-based systems?
	add a SetMenuMode() so games can get a Continue/Reset/Exit (and get standby mode)?
	update README
		if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System.pak/lib"

emulators
	pokemini
		should power down before exiting

	fceux
		inconsistent performance issues

	gpsp
		grab latest from https://git.crowdedwood.com/picogpsp/commit/

		add mmenu
		
	pcsx_rearmed
