=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists
	
=======================================

Release Notes:
- updated PlayStation emulator (hold MENU and press L/R to trigger L2/R2 instead of L1/R1, adds stretched Software Scaling, defaults to off)
- updated Super Nintendo emulator (adds Show FPS option, adds stretched Scaling: Overscan)
- updated TurboGrafx-16 emulator (not sure what changed...)
As always, thanks eggs, neonloop, and gameblabla!

=======================================

emulators
	all
		support loading save state by number
			present
				pcsx -load i
				picodrive -load i

			kindof
				pokemini -state path (this is an autostate not a save state)
				temper s (autoloads state 0)

			missing
				fceux
				gambatte
				race
				snes9x2002
		standardize bios locations
			I would prefer they all live in the emu folder not the rom folder but...
	pokemini
		should power off before exiting
	gpsp
		grab latest from https://git.crowdedwood.com/picogpsp/commit/
		eggs tweaks: https://discord.com/channels/529983248114122762/540168599063756802/824180283963605022
		add mmenu
	handy
		- don't do it! (but the dimensions are perfect and I'm curious! :dies:)
	oswan
		- eggs made improvements to audio and framerate, is it good enough?
	fceux
		- 
	pcsx_rearmed
		-
	picodrive
		- 
	sms_sdl
		-
	snes9x2002
		- 
	temper
		-

MinUI
	add multi-disc icon when m3u is found?
	load directly into a save slot?
		press X to Resume (using most recently saved slot?) instead of A to Open? or press SELECT to toggle a mode? show preview image?
		we can detect saves in the .mmenu folder
			each emulator would have to be updated to load a slot by number (most are probably by filename...)

	allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting	
		update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
		or add entry->sortName
		check sorting logic to make sure it isn't converting all non-alpha to 0
			sort dir above rom?
	
	look into GMenuNX's brightness modifications
	
	is tearing patch affecting battery?
		is the device running hotter?
		can we reverse it to improve battery when sleeping?
			check eggs tearing test source	
		also look into CPU Timer, page 84 of F1C200s manual

general
	figure out how to gracefully recover from a bad update
		eg. if the update zip file is incomplete or otherwise corrupted during transfer to the SD card
	add a quickstart section to readme
		make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
		add info about USB Bridge + webadb.com to upload files over USB
		also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
		mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions?

	document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator
	
	wrap functions shared by MinUI and libmmenu into a shared source file?
		yes, please!
	
	document submodule upstream urls since they get lost when cloned
		automate somehow?
	
	poke at audio when I have free night
		put this in a loop but track state and only putenv when it changes
			
			if (access("/dev/dsp1", 4)==0) putenv("AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp1"); // assuming headphones
			else putenv("AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp"); // speaker

libmmenu
	update ShowMenu() to omit Save/Load when save_template_path is NULL (for Games)
	update README
		document kStatusChangeDisc and /tmp/change_disc
		if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System/lib"

paks
	make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak?

games
	cavestory
		change Plantation password to "yrotS evaC" (or at least remove the leading "L" from the existing password)
		add ShowMenu("/mnt/SDCARD/Games/Cave Story.pak", NULL, 0);

rescue things from old repo
