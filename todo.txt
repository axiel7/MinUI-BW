=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists
	
=======================================

**STOP! Are you currently playing a Game Boy Advance game?** Recently MinUI switched to a different Game Boy Advance emulator. Save data (created in the game) is compatible but save states (created in the emulator menu) are not. Please make sure you have created in-game saves before updating. The new emulator also does not support cheats (yet!). If you do not want to update right now, put an empty file named `no-update` (no extension) in `/Emus/Game Boy Advance.pak`. When you _are_ ready to update, just remove this file and update to the latest version of MinUI as you normally would.

Please see the readme.txt in the zip file for installation instructions.

- updated Game Boy Advance emulator (was preventing proper sleep in menu)
- MinUI now handles m3u files with Windows line-endings properly (rookie mistake)

As always, thanks eggs, neonloop, and gameblabla!

=======================================

TODO: added separate games archive with VVVVVV and Cave Story?
	can't share Cave Story source
	can't share VVVVVV data.zip
or individual zips for each game?
 	that kinda makes more sense since they're larger and may not be desired by everyone

TODO: Info.pak 
	credits?
	shortcuts?
	QR code linking to the Releases page on GitHub or the readme? Both?
		readme is helpful but is releases? Since downloading on your phone isn't that helpful...

MinUI+libmmenu
	m3u support isn't handling Windows line-endings

libmmenu
	scroll or at least mask longer names?
	add charge indicator

MinUI
	average charge value to stop fluctuations at icon change boundaries?
	continuously scroll long names?
	
	is there a way to remember the MinUI name for a pak?
		so a pak can be updated even if renamed?
		if <name>.pak/default_name.txt doesn't exist write <name> to it
			do shell scripts have arrays? hashes?
			maybe before updating each we build a list mapping default to custom
			then when updating we look up the custom path from the default one in that file?

	look at how GMenuNX launches emulators
		 uses exec() to replace itself with the emulator
		 could allow me to get rid of next.sh
	
	is tearing patch affecting battery?
		is the device running hotter?
		can we reverse it to improve battery when sleeping?
			check eggs tearing test source	
		also look into CPU Timer, page 84 of F1C200s manual
		
	file system based settings?
		checkboxes (eg. enable screenshots, enable suspend/resume?)
		select menus (eg. sleep timeout/disable, choose console names?)
	
	add neonloop's modified so files to System/lib?
	
	
emulators
	all
		standardize bios locations
			I would prefer they all live in the emu folder not the rom folder but...
	pokemini
		should power off before exiting (or add note to readme that that's how games save to sram?)
	picogpsp
		BUG: brightness isn't being set to 0 when sleeping from in-emulator menu
		
		TODO: try moving dlopen(mmenu) to after the fread that creates the issue
		
			it might be that no system() calls are succeeding here, it's this
				stops working in load_gamepak_raw()
				between between fread(gamepak_rom, 1, file_size, fd); and fclose(fd);
	gpsp-bittboy
		remove submodule
		link to picogpsp repo
		archive repo
	oswan
		eggs has more scalers
			waiting to hear back if he was seeking feedback or recommending for release
				he's released a new version so I should just diff that source
	scummvm
		https://git.crowdedwood.com/scummvm-rg350/
		maybe MinUI could special case its weird rom format?

		BUG: restoring state of a CD game doesn't work reliably
			do CD games need a delay before restoring from menu?
				I'm using a built in load state flag so I don't _think_ this is my bug...
			Final Fight CD states created after entering the subway car will load but only play music

general
	look into patching SDL lib to remove charge testing?
	
	add a quickstart section to readme
		make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
		note stock shortcuts for brightness/volume
		add info about USB Bridge + webadb.com to upload files over USB
		also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
			not actually necessary
		mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions?
		document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator
		document no-update file in paks
	
	wrap functions shared by MinUI, utilities, and libmmenu into a shared source file?
		yes, please!
	
	document submodule upstream urls (for myself) since they get lost when cloned
		automate somehow?

	can we fix the orphaned clusters SD card problem or would that require kernel changes?

games
	vvvvvv
		add mmenu
			pause music in menu!
		integrate into makefile
			maybe separate project? minui-games?
		restore editor menu once text input is implemented? (not urgent, requires USB keyboard to use)
	cavestory
		change Plantation password to "yrotS evaC" (or at least remove the leading "L" from the existing password)
			not urgent (can't figure out where to do this anyway :sweat_smile:)
		can I ever release this?
			cavestory.org has CSE2 ports available for download so maybe sharing a binary is fine?

rescue things from old repo
	art
	todos

add more variation/peripheral paks?
	WonderSwan Color.pak?
	Sega CD.pak?
	Sega 32x.pak?
	TurboGrafx-CD.pak?
	Turbo Duo.pak? (was this just a combo TurboGrafx-16 + TurboGrafx-CD? yes)
or remove all variations and leave it up to the user to create and organize?
maybe don't create any Rom folders, let people choose from the zip?
