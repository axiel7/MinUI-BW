=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists
	
=======================================

Please see the readme.txt in the zip file for installation instructions.

As always, thanks eggs, neonloop, and gameblabla!

=======================================

TODO: mention Tips.pak in README.txt

under consideration
	share native game paks?
		https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d56fljlyuc3brd9/AAA5YGRNOa1IK7TOd3rWsEnOa?dl=0

	recognize neonloop's dynamic-libs.zip and automatically unzip into /System/libs?
		will it get nuked on update? test

MinUI+libmmenu
	continuously scroll long names?

libmmenu
	switch to MinUI's Input_* API

MinUI
	is there a way to remember the MinUI name for a pak?
		so a pak can be updated even if renamed?
		if <name>.pak/default_name.txt doesn't exist write <name> to it
			do shell scripts have arrays? hashes?
			maybe before updating each we build a list mapping default to custom
			then when updating we look up the custom path from the default one in that file?

	look at how GMenuNX launches emulators
		 uses exec() to replace itself with the emulator
		 could allow me to get rid of next.sh
		
	file system based settings?
		checkboxes (eg. enable screenshots, enable suspend/resume?, enable tips on boot)
		select menus (eg. sleep timeout/disable, choose console names?)	

emulators
	all
		standardize bios locations
			I would prefer they all live in the emu folder not the rom folder but...
	pokemini
		should power off before exiting (or add note to readme that that's how games save to sram?)
	picogpsp
		-
	gpsp-bittboy
		remove submodule
		link to picogpsp repo
		archive repo
	oswan
		-
	picodrive
		BUG: Streets of Rage music is slightly off
		BUG: restoring state of a CD game doesn't work reliably
			do CD games need a delay before restoring from menu?
				I'm using a built in load state flag so I don't _think_ this is my bug...
			Final Fight CD states created after entering the subway car will load but only play music
	scummvm
		https://git.crowdedwood.com/scummvm-rg350/
		maybe MinUI could special case its weird rom format? bad precedent
			https://retropie.org.uk/docs/ScummVM/
	xm8
		check out eggs PC-88 emulator

general
	add a quickstart section to readme
		make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
		note stock shortcuts for brightness/volume
		add info about USB Bridge + webadb.com to upload files over USB
		also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
			not actually necessary
		mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions?
		document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator
		document no-update file in paks
	
	wrap functions shared by MinUI, utilities, and libmmenu into a shared source file?
		yes, please!
	
	document submodule upstream urls (for myself) since they get lost when cloned
		automate somehow?
