BUG:
	with zero items in main list you can still select 1/0

add comments to the top all the files with identical names, eg. launch.sh and updater

allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting
	update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
	or add entry->sortName

scroll long names

make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection

document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator

update libmmenu README
	if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System.pak/lib"

rescue things from old repo
	art
	todos

pull in (need to find base source repos closest to eggs)
	fceux
	picodrive
	temper
	pcsx4all

gambatte-dms
	remove build date, replaced with last commit date

sms_sdl
	revisit gg arg to support new REMAP-ing launch.sh (use strncmp() to check for "gg" specifically)
	what does START do on SMS? it seems to change the volume on Phantasy Star's title screen, also A & B seem to start
