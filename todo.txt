=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other options for tinkerers

=======================================

reorg System.pak?
	
	System/
		bin/
			confirm
			encode
			show
		lib/
			libmmenu.so
		res/
		System.pak
		Update.pak
	
	so a Trimui-less SD root would look like
	
		Emus
		Games
		Roms
		System
		Tools
		TrimuiUpdate_MinUI.zip
	
	requiring updater to delete System.pak and Update.pak
	relocate recent.txt and can-sleep to .minui/
	
		update paths to recent.txt
		update paths that use System.pak
		update makefile
	
	test on stock card first :sweat_smile:


check all emulators
	to make sure save data is persisted to disk when only using ShowMenu()
	also pokemini should poweroff before exiting

allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting	
	update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
	or add entry->sortName
	check sorting logic to make sure it isn't converting all non-alpha to 0
		sort dir above rom

cavestory
	add SetMenuMode() && ShowMenu()

scroll long names

pak
	add an filter.txt to only show files with extensions in the filter list
		eg. PlayStation.pak/filter.txt could contain bin since it favors .cue

make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak?

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
	also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
	note PlayStation bios location
	mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions

document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator

figure out how to distribute Wipe Stock.pak
	maybe make a separate TrimuiUpdate_MinUIExtras.zip for installing and updating extras?

libmmenu
	add support for switching discs on disc-based systems?
	add a SetMenuMode() so games can get a Continue/Advanced/Exit menu with no Save/Load (and get standby mode?)
	update README
		if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System.pak/lib"
	
rescue things from old repo
	art
	todos

pull in (need to find base source repos closest to eggs)
	picodrive
	temper

pcsx_rearmed
	need to note that you need to delete your /Roms/PlayStation/.pcsx/pcsx.cfg file

fceux
	unacceptable performance issues

gpsp
	grab latest from https://git.crowdedwood.com/picogpsp/commit/
	add mmenu
