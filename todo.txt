=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists
	
=======================================

Release Notes
	- you'll need to delete your /Roms/PlayStation/.pcsx/pcsx.cfg file if updating from last beta
	- wake from sleep by holding L and R and then pressing any other button
	- sleep is now available from the in-emulator menu too
	- ignores system brightness and volume shortcuts while sleeping
	- underclocks CPU while sleeping in attempt to conserve battery (thanks eggs!)
	- moved around some folders to tidy up the root of the SD card
	- lcd tearing patch to reduce tearing (thanks eggs!)
	- added Nintendo emulator
	- misc emulator fixes

=======================================

get picodrive in next so I can remove bin/encode

look into GMenuNX's brightness modifications

can MinUI load directly into a save slot?
	we can detect saves in the .mmenu folder
		each emulator would have to be updated to load a slot by number (most are probably by filename...)

allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting	
	update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
	or add entry->sortName
	check sorting logic to make sure it isn't converting all non-alpha to 0
		sort dir above rom?

cavestory
	add SetMenuMode() && ShowMenu()

pak
	add a filter.txt to only show files with extensions in the filter list
		should it be an ignore list or a match list? match makes more sense I think
		eg. PlayStation.pak/filter.txt could contain bin since it favors .cue

make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak?

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
	also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
	note PlayStation bios location
	mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions

document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator

libmmenu
	add support for switching discs on disc-based systems?
	add a SetMenuMode() so games can get a Continue/Reset/Exit (and get standby mode)?
	update README
		if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System.pak/lib"
	
rescue things from old repo
	art
	todos

pull in (need to find base source repos closest to eggs)
	picodrive
	temper

pcsx_rearmed
	get latest config fix

pokemini
	should power down before exiting

fceux
	unacceptable performance issues?

gpsp
