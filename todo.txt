revise L/R alpha skip
	create an index array that holds the index of the first entry by char (to lower with special case for non a-z chars)
	add an alphaIndex to each entry
	skipping is just +/- 1 to that index to lookup the corresponding first entry of that char
	pass Dir* to get*() functions?
	
flag duplicate names
	in Directory_new? loop over self->entries?
	or add an EntryArray_push() to handle it?
	display full name or an extension pill for adjacent dupes?

scroll long names?

killall keymon from System.pak/launch.sh
	handle L/R shortcuts in MinUI and libmmenu?
	lift restrictions on using those for custom bindings in libmmenu readme?

switch to eggs' .tmp_update soft-install method?
