BUG:
	sometimes launches into 100% complete bar
	quit and launch notify/updateui as needed instead of trying to leave it running for updater
		didn't work
	use this time measure to figureout where we're stalling
		read up rest </proc/uptime; NOW="${up%.*}${up#*.}"; touch "/tmp/$NOW action name"
		can't reproduce while this debugging code is on so it's probably a timing issue

add eggs tearing patch directly to MinUI

add a sleep mode to MinUI and libmmennu.so
	after 30s of inactivity or pressing MENU
		black out screen
		set brightness and volume to 0
		delay 2s
		check for input (MENU or a button combo? L+R+SELECT+START?)
			restore original brightness and volume values
			resume normal updates
	try with eggs underclocking code to 192MHz

add comments to the top all the files with identical names, eg. launch.sh and updater

allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting
	update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
	or add entry->sortName

scroll long names

make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
	also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
	note PlayStation bios location
	mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions

document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator

libmmenu
	add support for switching discs on disc-based systems?
	update README
		if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System.pak/lib"
	
rescue things from old repo
	art
	todos

pull in (need to find base source repos closest to eggs)
	fceux
	picodrive
	temper

pcsx_rearmed
	build with 
		CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/trimui-toolchain/bin/arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabi- ./configure --platform=trimui && make
	default to bios included in /usr/trimui? (they're PAL, is that a problem?)
		copy into PlayStation.pak during install/update?

gpsp
	make sure scaling settings are saved

gambatte-dms
	remove build date, replaced with last commit date

sms_sdl
	revisit gg arg to support new REMAP-ing launch.sh (use strncmp() to check for "gg" specifically)
	what does START do on SMS? it seems to change the volume on Phantasy Star's title screen, also A & B seem to start
