fceux
	add mmenu

ISSUE: tearing fix
	is this causing garbage to draw to screen when closing emulators?

allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting
	update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
	or add entry->sortName

scroll long names

pak
	add an filter.txt to only show files with extensions in the filter list
		eg. PlayStation.pak ignore.txt could contain bin, etc (favors .cue)

make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
	also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
	note PlayStation bios location
	mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions

document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator

libmmenu
	add support for switching discs on disc-based systems?
	update README
		if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System.pak/lib"
