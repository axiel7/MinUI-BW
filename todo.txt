BUG:
	with zero items in main list you can still select 1/0

BUG:
	sometimes launches into 100% complete bar
	quit and launch notify/updateui as needed instead of trying to leave it running for updater
		didn't work
	use this time measure to figureout where we're stalling
		read up rest </proc/uptime; NOW="${up%.*}${up#*.}"; touch "/tmp/$NOW action name"
		can't reproduce while this debugging code is on so it's probably a timing issue (at least with /mnt/SDCARD we'll see if /tmp is any different)
	
add a sleep mode to MinUI and libmmennu.so
	after 30s of inactivity
		black out screen
		set brightness to 0 (after storing current value)
		delay 2s
		check for inut
			restore brightness
			resume normal updates

add comments to the top all the files with identical names, eg. launch.sh and updater

allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting
	update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
	or add entry->sortName

scroll long names

make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
	also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost

document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator

update libmmenu README
	if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System.pak/lib"

rescue things from old repo
	art
	todos

pull in (need to find base source repos closest to eggs)
	fceux
	picodrive
	temper
	pcsx4all

gambatte-dms
	remove build date, replaced with last commit date

sms_sdl
	revisit gg arg to support new REMAP-ing launch.sh (use strncmp() to check for "gg" specifically)
	what does START do on SMS? it seems to change the volume on Phantasy Star's title screen, also A & B seem to start
