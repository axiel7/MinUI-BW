=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists
	
=======================================

Release Notes:
- Roms folder now supports nested folders (useful for multi-file disc-based games)
- added TurboGrafx-16 emulator
- added Genesis emulator
- updated Game Gear/Master System emulator (menu audio fix, new Fullscreen Sharp scaling option, new toggle FM Sound)
- updated PlayStation emulator (per game configs)
- removed /System/bin/encode (only used by betas to launch stock emus)
As always, thanks @eggs and @neonloop!

=======================================

emulators
	temper
		revise makefile with eggs suggestion? https://discord.com/channels/529983248114122762/540168599063756802/824894214856245319
		test (Rondo of Blood might be the most interesting to me?)
			needs syscard3.bin (tried with smaller syscard3.pce got static but that might be caused by audio)
	pokemini
		should power off before exiting
	gpsp
		grab latest from https://git.crowdedwood.com/picogpsp/commit/
		eggs tweaks: https://discord.com/channels/529983248114122762/540168599063756802/824180283963605022
		add mmenu
	fceux
		inconsistent performance issues
	pcsx_rearmed
		-
	picodrive
		- 
	sms_sdl

general
	switch to github releases instead of just uploading a zip to #releases-trimui
	figure out how to gracefully recover from a bad update
		eg. if the update zip file is incomplete or otherwise corrupted during transfer to the SD card
	add a quickstart section to readme
		make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
		also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
		mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions?

	document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator
	
	wrap functions shared by MinUI and libmmenu into a shared source file?
	
	document submodule upstream urls since they get lost when cloned
		automate somehow?
	
	poke at audio when I have free night
		put this in a loop but track state and only putenv when it changes
			
			if (access("/dev/dsp1", 4)==0) putenv("AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp1"); // assuming headphones
			else putenv("AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp"); // speaker

MinUI
	load directly into a save slot?
		press X to Resume (using most recently saved slot?) instead of A to Open? or press SELECT to toggle a mode? show preview image?
		we can detect saves in the .mmenu folder
			each emulator would have to be updated to load a slot by number (most are probably by filename...)

	allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting	
		update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
		or add entry->sortName
		check sorting logic to make sure it isn't converting all non-alpha to 0
			sort dir above rom?
	
	look into GMenuNX's brightness modifications
	
	is tearing patch affecting battery?
		is the device running hotter?
		can we reverse it to improve battery when sleeping?
			check eggs tearing test source	
		also look into CPU Timer, page 84 of F1C200s manual

paks
	make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak?
	add a filter.txt to only show files with extensions in the filter list
		should it be an ignore list or a match list? match makes more sense I think
		eg. PlayStation.pak/filter.txt could contain bin since it favors .cue
		eg. TurboGrafx-16.pak should only display .pce or .cue (check others)

libmmenu
	add support for switching discs on disc-based systems?
	add a SetMenuMode() so games can get a Continue/Reset/Exit (and get standby mode)?
	update README
		if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System.pak/lib"

games
	cavestory
		add SetMenuMode() && ShowMenu()
