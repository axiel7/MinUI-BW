=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists
	
=======================================

Release Notes:

- 

As always, thanks eggs, neonloop, and gameblabla!

=======================================

remove Trimui firmware version from releases?

add more variation/peripheral paks?
	WonderSwan Color.pak?
	Sega CD.pak?
	Sega 32x.pak?
	TurboGrafx-CD.pak?
	Turbo Duo.pak? (was this just a combo TurboGrafx-16 + TurboGrafx-CD? yes)
or remove all variations and leave it up to the user to create and organize?
maybe don't create any Rom folders, let people choose from the zip?

Info.pak with credits, shortcuts, and a QR code linking to the Releases page on GitHub or the readme? Both?

MinUI
	either
		figure out how to migrate from one emulator to another
		or allow selecting which emulator from a pak to use
		:thinking_face:
	handle swap in System.pak/launch
		or add System/bin/needs-swap shell script
	
	add neonloop's modified so files to System/lib?
	
	is there a way to remember the MinUI name for a pak?
		so a pak can be updated even if renamed?
		if <name>.pak/default_name.txt doesn't exist write <name> to it
			do shell scripts have arrays? hashes?
			maybe before updating each we build a list mapping default to custom
			then when updating we look up the custom path from the default one in that file?

	look at how GMenuNX launches emulators
		 uses exec() to replace itself with the emulator
		 could allow me to get rid of next.sh
	
	is tearing patch affecting battery?
		is the device running hotter?
		can we reverse it to improve battery when sleeping?
			check eggs tearing test source	
		also look into CPU Timer, page 84 of F1C200s manual
		
	file system based settings?
		checkboxes (eg. enable screenshots, enable suspend/resume)
		select menus (eg. sleep timeout/disable, choose console names?)

flipbook
	-

emulators
	all
		standardize bios locations
			I would prefer they all live in the emu folder not the rom folder but...
	pokemini
		should power off before exiting (or add note to readme that that's how games save to sram?)
	picogpsp
		finish integrating
			hold for audio bug fixes
			hold for cheats?
		update post.sh in Game Boy Advance.pak
			nand gba_bios.bin is no longer necessary
			if .gpsp folder exists
				copy any .sav files from .gpsp into .picogpsp
				delete gpsp binary (or leave to allow editing the launch.sh?)
					delete .gpsp folder
					delete .mmenu folder (save states aren't compatible but is this necessary?)
	gpsp-bittboy
		retired
		link to picogpsp repo
	oswan
		eggs has more scalers
			waiting to hear back if he was seeking feedback or recommending for release
				he's released a new version so I should just diff that source
	scummvm
		https://git.crowdedwood.com/scummvm-rg350/
		maybe MinUI could special case its weird rom format?
			https://retropie.org.uk/docs/ScummVM/
	fceux
		-
	pcsx_rearmed
		- 
	picodrive
		BUG: restoring state of a CD game doesn't work reliably
			CD games need a delay before restoring from menu
			Final Fight CD states created after entering the subway car will load but only play music

general
	add a quickstart section to readme
		make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
		note stock shortcuts for brightness/volume
		add info about USB Bridge + webadb.com to upload files over USB
		also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
			not actually necessary
		mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions?
		document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator
		document no-update file in paks
	
	wrap functions shared by MinUI, utilities, and libmmenu into a shared source file?
		yes, please!
	
	document submodule upstream urls (for myself) since they get lost when cloned
		automate somehow?

	can we fix the orphaned clusters SD card problem or would that require kernel changes?

paks
	make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak?

games
	vvvvvv
		hold till I sort swap at the System level
		add mmenu
			pause music in menu!
		integrate into makefile
		restore editor menu once text input is implemented? (not urgent, requires USB keyboard to use)
	cavestory
		change Plantation password to "yrotS evaC" (or at least remove the leading "L" from the existing password)
		can I ever release this?
			as a diff of another arm cse2 release? do those even exist?
			cavestory.org has CSE2 ports available for download so maybe sharing a binary is fine?

libmmenu
	make Y take two screenshots at once, one with the menu, one without instead of binding both X and Y
	add charge indicator

rescue things from old repo
