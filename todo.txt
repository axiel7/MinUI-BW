=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists
	
=======================================

Please see the readme.txt in the zip file for installation instructions.

- added native support for USB headphones
- fixed black square in top left corner of screen on exit
- updated patched keymon with improved headphone support
- reduced custom SDL lib file size (from 1.2MB to 233KB)

As always, thanks eggs, neonloop, and gameblabla!

=======================================

TODO: remove adbd from System.pak/launch.sh!
TODO: HazMan1988 reports PS1 games are crashy with custom SDL
	does this have something to do with resolution switching?
	
TODO: add audio input switching to SDL
TODO: look into eggs suspend feature
	he sleeps other processes
	might not be necessary for 
	MinUI/libmmenu since it's 
	invoked by a running process

TODO: mention Tips.pak in README.txt
TODO: add native games QR code to Tips.pak?

TODO: some emulators aren't wiping the screen on quit (is this a regression?)
TODO: buttons pressed when entering menu stay pressed upon exiting

under consideration
	share native game paks?
		https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d56fljlyuc3brd9/AAA5YGRNOa1IK7TOd3rWsEnOa?dl=0

	recognize neonloop's dynamic-libs.zip and automatically unzip into /System/libs?
		will it get nuked on update? no

MinUI+libmmenu
	continuously scroll long names?
	support localization
		localized strings files
		most text is in images
			not just text but all the button prompts are hardcoded too...
				eg. USB Bridge.pak
				eg. the QR code in Tips.pak
		some strings are built programmatically
			eg. System/Update.pak
		would need an alternative to bin/show, bin/confirm, even bin/flipbook :weary:
		I don't think the current typeface supports anything beyond ascii :sob:
		
		modes
			just text, centered (manually wrapped), eg. wake.png
			prompt, centered text, buttons at bottom, eg. USB Bridge.pak
			layout, centered text, centered header, buttons along bottom, eg. Tips.pak
				multi-paged :cold_sweat:

libmmenu
	switch to MinUI's Input_* API

MinUI
	BUG: if Games only contains subfolders (no paks) it won't appear
		eg. if you only add Doom (which contains paks for each wad) and no other game paks
	
	remove Color versions of Game Boy and Neo Geo Pocket paks?
		add variations like this to an Extras folder with its own readme

	is there a way to remember the MinUI name for a pak?
		so a pak can be updated even if renamed?
		if <name>.pak/default_name.txt doesn't exist write <name> to it
			do shell scripts have arrays? hashes?
			maybe before updating each we build a list mapping default to custom
			then when updating we look up the custom path from the default one in that file?

	look at how GMenuNX launches emulators
		 uses exec() to replace itself with the emulator
		 could allow me to get rid of next.sh
		
	file system based settings?
		checkboxes (eg. enable screenshots, enable suspend/resume?, enable tips on boot)
		select menus (eg. sleep timeout/disable, language, choose console names?)	

emulators
	gpsp-bittboy
		remove submodule
		link to picogpsp repo
		archive repo

	all
		standardize bios locations
			I would prefer they all live in the emu folder not the rom folder but...
	pokemini
		should power off before exiting (or add note to readme that that's how games save to sram?)
	picogpsp
		-
	oswan
		-
	picodrive
		BUG: Streets of Rage music is slightly off
		BUG: restoring state of a CD game doesn't work reliably
			do CD games need a delay before restoring from menu?
				I'm using a built in load state flag so I don't _think_ this is my bug...
			Final Fight CD states created after entering the subway car will load but only play music

paks
	Dead Pixel Reanimator.pak
		just need to fork, branch, commit my changes, submodule and potentially add to makefile
			https://github.com/retrofw/pixmassage
		probably more of an Extras thing
	Commander.pak
		merge in latest additions from (or just switch to entirely?):
			https://github.com/od-contrib/commander/

general
	remove old paks from archive
	
	add a quickstart section to readme
		make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
		note stock shortcuts for brightness/volume
		add info about USB Bridge + webadb.com to upload files over USB
		also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
			not actually necessary
		mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions?
		document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator
		document no-update file in paks
	
	wrap functions shared by MinUI, utilities, and libmmenu into a shared source file?
		yes, please!
	
	document submodule upstream urls (for myself) since they get lost when cloned
		automate somehow?
