=======================================

Remember the goals:

	no configuration
	near 1:1 relationship to SD card (like a console flash cart)
	quality over quantity (don't seek to answer the question "can it run?" but rather "is the resulting experience worth having?")
	easy to maintain (for me because I only have limited time, and of course for the user)
	
	there are other, better options for tinkerers and archivists
	
=======================================

Release Notes:

- press X to launch a rom straight into the most recently used save state (only available for save states created or loaded after installing this update)
- added WonderSwan/WonderSwan Color emulator
- added System/bin/flipbook (used to make paks with browsable 320x240 pngs/bmps)

As always, thanks eggs, neonloop, and gameblabla!

=======================================

MinUI
	add multi-disc icon when m3u is found?
	allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting	
		update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
		or add entry->sortName
		check sorting logic to make sure it isn't converting all non-alpha to 0
			sort dir above rom?
	
	look into GMenuNX's brightness modifications
	
	is tearing patch affecting battery?
		is the device running hotter?
		can we reverse it to improve battery when sleeping?
			check eggs tearing test source	
		also look into CPU Timer, page 84 of F1C200s manual

flipbook
	add an x/y pill overlay that disappears 1-2 seconds after changing images

emulators
	standardize bios locations
		I would prefer they all live in the emu folder not the rom folder but...
	picogpsp
		finish integrating
		update post.sh in Game Boy Advance.pak
			nand gba_bios.bin is no longer necessary
			if .gpsp folder exists
				copy any .sav files from .gpsp into .picogpsp
				delete .gpsp folder
				delete .mmenu folder (save states aren't compatible but is this necessary?)
				delete gpsp binary (or leave to allow editing the launch.sh?)
	pokemini
		should power off before exiting
	handy
		don't do it! (but the dimensions are perfect and I'm curious! :dies:)

general
	can we fix the orphaned clusters SD card problem or would that require kernel changes?
		https://elinux.org/images/5/54/Elc2011_munegowda.pdf
	keymin
		feasible with what we've learned?
	figure out how to gracefully recover from a bad update
		eg. if the update zip file is incomplete or otherwise corrupted during transfer to the SD card
	add a quickstart section to readme
		make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
		add info about USB Bridge + webadb.com to upload files over USB
		also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
		mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions?

	document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator
	
	wrap functions shared by MinUI, utilities, and libmmenu into a shared source file?
		yes, please!
	
	document submodule upstream urls since they get lost when cloned
		automate somehow?
	
	poke at audio when I have free night
		put this in a loop but track state and only putenv when it changes
			
			if (access("/dev/dsp1", 4)==0) putenv("AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp1"); // assuming headphones
			else putenv("AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp"); // speaker

paks
	make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak?

games
	cavestory
		change Plantation password to "yrotS evaC" (or at least remove the leading "L" from the existing password)
		can I ever release this?
