scroll long names?

switch to eggs' .tmp_update soft-install method?

figure out an update mechanism

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection

rescue things from old repo
	art
	todos

pull in (need to find base source repos closest to eggs)
	fceux
	picodrive
	temper
	snes9x4d
	pcsx4all

killall keymon from System.pak/launch.sh
	handle L/R shortcuts in MinUI and libmmenu?
		this is doable but I need to store the changes to brightness/volume myself
		but would conflict with keymon still running when emulators are launched from gmenu
	lift restrictions on using those for custom bindings in libmmenu readme?
