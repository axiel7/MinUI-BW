check all emulators
	to make sure save data is persisted to disk when only using ShowMenu()
	also pokemini should poweroff before exiting

allow "000 - " before filename to control sorting	
	update EntryArray_sortEntry() to use strrchr(item->path)+1 instead of item->name
	or add entry->sortName
	check sorting logic to make sure it isn't converting all non-alpha to 0
		sort dir above rom

cavestory
	how does ShowMenu() work with games? does it?
		can I just hack it to create a save anywhere? (probably not...right?)
		look into SaveProfile() and LoadProfile()
	font is too small
		game_english/data/Font/font_bitmap_6x12.png/dat
		I can redraw it but the dat file will be problematic
			I could create my own data format and write a shim to get the runtime data into the expected shape...but not tonight
			see LoadBitmapFont()
		
move saves to common folder
	but which common folder?
	on second thought, since these folders are all invisible,
		I don't love the idea of saves being too far away from 
		a folder highly trafficked by the player...

scroll long names

pak
	clean up various launch.sh. Use base name on rom dir for emu name.
		redo emulator name detection to support subfolders
	add an filter.txt to only show files with extensions in the filter list
		eg. PlayStation.pak ignore.txt could contain bin since it favors .cue

make a Backup Saves.pak and a Restore Saves.pak?

add a quickstart section to readme
	make clear the `Roms/Console Name` and `Emus/Console Name.pak` connection
	also note to use Power Off to make sure that save states don't get lost
	note PlayStation bios location
	mention GBA, PSX, and 32x using dynarec which may have performance issues initially that go away after playing for a bit and it caches instructions

document new REMPAP launch.sh for multiple rom types that use the same emulator

libmmenu
	add support for switching discs on disc-based systems?
	update README
		if you are creating a custom launcher and want to support libmmenu you need to call
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/SDCARD/System.pak/lib"
	
rescue things from old repo
	art
	todos

pull in (need to find base source repos closest to eggs)
	picodrive
	temper

pcsx_rearmed
	need to note that you need to delete your /Roms/PlayStation/.pcsx/pcsx.cfg file

fceux
	might have performance issues (or adbd could have been dragging the system down)
