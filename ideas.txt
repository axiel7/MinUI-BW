an installer that deletes itself after installation
	needs to run from StockUI and MinUI
		MinUI should show TrimuiUpdate_MinUI.zip as Update below Tools
	first I need to get MinUI running from .tmp_update
	need to either figure out how to launch updateui from MinUI or create my own version
	create a pak to remove stock cachefile and folders (Cleaner.pak?)
		should explain what it does and request confirmation
		deleting this stuff has caused issues on the stock card, haven't tried on my sandisk yet
	
	rename System.pak to .system?
	
	
	NOTE: this might be out of date...
